      <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
      <p><br><br>My work has always been influenced by movies, videogames, and comic books. As such, I have tailored my art to be heavily focused on the creation of characters to be used in comic books and or animations. One such project started as an impulse to have my family describe themselves as “superheroes”. I have since developed this idea into creating characters to inhabit a world that I hope to turn into a web based show.<br><br>Each character I created for this project has been made with a specific story role in mind, and their “abilities” are demonstrated in the works themselves. For example, one of the “villains” is able to increase his strength and size, however, it reduces his speed affects his sanity. This is represented by half of his face and his right arm being a different tone of skin than the rest of him, as well as his arm being disproportional to his body.<br><br>
